### `wpswiper_frontend_js_register_args` Filter

The `wpswiper_frontend_js_register_args` filter allows users to customize parameters when enqueueing the `frontend-js` script. This filter enables you to modify the script's dependencies, control whether it loads in the footer, and specify additional loading strategies such as `async` or `defer`.

#### Parameters

- **`deps`**: (array) The script dependencies for `frontend-js`. Default value is `['wpswiper-bundle']`. You can modify this to include additional dependencies or remove existing ones.
  
- **`args`**: (array|bool) An optional array for additional script loading strategies. If provided, it may be an array with a `strategy` key (set to either `'async'` or `'defer'`). If not specified, it defaults to `false`, indicating that no special loading strategy is applied.

For more information, read the [WordPress documentation on wp_enqueue_script](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/).

#### Example Usage

To modify the default values, add the following code to your `functions.php` file or your custom plugin:

`

add_filter('wpswiper_frontend_js_register_args', function($args) {
    // Modify script dependencies
    $args['deps'] = ['wpswiper-bundle', 'jquery', 'your-custom-dependency'];

    // Specify an additional loading strategy, such as async or defer
    $args['args'] = [
		'in_footer' => false, 
		'strategy' => 'defer'
	]; // Options: 'async' or 'defer'

    return $args;
});

`

This filter provides flexibility in how the `frontend-js` script is loaded, allowing for optimizations tailored to your specific site needs.

## API Parameters

### Loop Parameters

#### `loopAddBlankSlides`
- **Type:** boolean
- **Default:** true
- **Description:** Automatically adds blank slides if you use Grid or slidesPerGroup and the total amount of slides is not even to slidesPerGroup or to grid.rows

#### `loopAdditionalSlides`
- **Type:** number
- **Default:** 0
- **Description:** Allows to increase amount of looped slides

---

!!! IMPORTANT !!!

I use this plugin internally to build awesome sliders. At the moment only essential Swiper options are available. More to come!!!

If you urgently need a feature, please reach out to me.
If you are a designer and have an interface design in mind, let me know.

The backend UI is not the prettiest thing at the moment. But it's very intuitive and does the job! The interface is set up as a series of tabs, each tab controls a slide. Click on the tab and you may upload an image. Click on the WP Swiper block and you can control slider overlay + color overlay.

Another note re: backend UI, the original idea was generate the functional slider within the editor. But theres an issue with conteneditable HTML elements. I lodged [an issue](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/3801) on official swiper github repo for them to resolve. Leave a comment for them to prioritise the solution.

If you want to use the slide with text. 
Select slide, add image, the image gonna appear as a background on the frontend.
If you want to use the slider for images, just add a regular image block.

Features:
<ul>
<li>Add image overlay for the whole slider + control opacity</li>
<li>Add color overlay for the whole slider + control opacity</li>
<li>Add image to the slider</li>
<li>Add content (text, headings, anything...) to the slider</li>
<li>Position content for each slider</li>
</ul>

More Features to be added:
<ul>
<li>Control height of the slider</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Other features from the official swiper docs</li>
</ul>
